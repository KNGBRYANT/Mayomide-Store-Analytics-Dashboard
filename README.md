# Mayomide-Store-Analytics-Dashboard



## Executive Summary

Mayomide Store required a comprehensive view of sales, profit, customer behavior, and product performance over a four-year period. An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to provide real-time insights across key metrics including Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, Quantity, and Average Discount. The solution reveals year-over-year trends, identifies top-performing markets and customer segments, and highlights product-level opportunities to guide pricing, marketing, and inventory strategies. The dashboard enhances operational visibility, supports faster decision-making, and highlights areas for strategic growth.

## Business Problem

Mayomide Store lacked a consolidated view of sales and customer patterns, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities, optimize inventory, or target the right customer segments. This limited visibility risked revenue losses, missed market opportunities, and inefficient marketing spend. Without a unified analytical framework, decision-making relied on fragmented reports and intuition rather than data-driven insights.

## Methodology

1. Collected historical sales and customer data spanning four years.
2. Cleaned and standardized the dataset including trimming, formatting, and ensuring correct data types.
3. Created a data table and established relationships for efficient analysis.
4. Generated age group column and dynamic field selection for key metrics: Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, Average Discount, and Quantity.
5. Developed DAX measures to calculate enriched metrics.
6. Built visualizations: aggregated metrics by month (column chart), market (bar chart), segment distribution (pie chart), and a decomposition tree for category, sub-category, and product performance.
7. Applied interactive filters for year, gender, age group, and metrics.
8. Enhanced usability with dynamic titles, color-coded highlights for top-performing months, and year-over-year comparison indicators.

## Skills & Tools Applied

* Power BI for dashboard creation and visualization
* DAX for dynamic calculations and measures
* Data cleaning, standardization, and transformation
* Interactive visualizations including column charts, bar charts, pie charts, and decomposition trees
* Conditional formatting and color-coding for insights
* Dynamic filtering and interactive selection indicators

## Key Findings

* Highest growth occurred between 2020 and 2021 with a 20.9% increase in profit and an 18.2% profit margin, driven by increased quantity sold and reduced average discount.
* The most profitable month in 2021 was November with total profit of 36,000.
* Europe was the top-performing market and the corporate segment contributed the highest profit.
* Body care was the leading category by profit, with Nail Care products as the highest subcategory; top products included Silver Mirage Necklace, Silver Enchantment Anklet, and Gold Solstice Necklace.
* Top loss-making products were Golden Veil Anklet, Sterling Gleam Ring, and Silver Spectrum Anklet.
* Male customers made the most purchases and contributed the highest profit, though high-performing products were primarily female-oriented, suggesting gift buying behavior.
* Age group 20–30 represents the most profitable segment, highlighting a potential target audience for marketing campaigns.
* 2022 recorded the highest overall profit of 45,000 with 73,018 units sold; June was the peak month.

## Recommendations

* Focus on high-performing markets to maximize revenue.
* Optimize inventory for top-selling products to meet demand efficiently.
* Monitor and adjust discount strategies to protect profit margins.
* Implement targeted marketing campaigns for the most profitable age groups.
* Consider limited edition sales or strategic adjustments for loss-making products to reduce financial impact.

## Next Steps / Future Work

* Incorporate predictive analytics for sales forecasting.
* Automate data refreshes to ensure real-time insights.
* Expand dashboard to track marketing campaign performance and customer acquisition metrics.
* Explore deeper segmentation analysis and cross-selling opportunities.

## Project Limitations

* Historical data may contain missing or inconsistent entries affecting insights.
* Profit calculations assume constant cost and discount structures.
* Analysis is limited to available datasets; additional behavioral or external market data could provide deeper insights.
